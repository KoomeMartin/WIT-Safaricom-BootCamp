# WIT-Safaricom-BootCamp
I will outline practical skills acquired in the WIT AI/ML  Boot Camp 2024

<h3>EDA Training </h3>

We don't EDA as a 'ritual" but rather with intent to unearth patterns in data.
Consider working with a bike sharing company (our dataset).
Lets assume we own the bike sharing company and we want to get insights that can drive value for our company. We can ask ourselves a couple of questions that we may need to answer from the data like:

<li>Which are the most common routes used?</li>
<p>Can we allocate more bikes in stations along this route Which are the most popular start stations?</p>
<p>Do we need more bikes here Is there a difference in trip duration/length for different types of members?</p>
<p>Is there a difference in trip duration/length by members based on rideable_type?</p>
<p>Which hour of the day do people often take trips</p>

I have tried to bring out answers to these few questions in this EDA section
